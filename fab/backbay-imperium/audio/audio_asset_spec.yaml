# ============================================================================
# AESTHETIC DIRECTION
# ============================================================================

aesthetic:
  overall_mood: |
    Museum-quality, dignified, scholarly.
    Warm and classical rather than flashy or epic-Hollywood.
    Think: Civilization V's contemplative elegance meets documentary gravitas.

  palette_alignment:
    gold: "Triumphant brass, victorious fanfares"
    bronze: "Military drums, martial themes"
    deep_blue: "Woodwinds, intellectual/scientific passages"
    terracotta: "Warm strings, cultural/domestic themes"
    forest_green: "Pastoral, nature, growth motifs"

  avoid:
    - Generic epic trailer music
    - Over-the-top Hans Zimmer bombast
    - Synthetic/electronic except subtle Modern era hints
    - Fast tempos (this is turn-based, contemplative)

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
# ============================================================================

implementation:

  dynamic_music_system:
    description: |
      Consider implementing a layered music system where:
      1. Era base theme plays continuously
      2. Civ motif layers in during diplomacy
      3. War variant crossfades when at war
      4. Intensity layers add/remove based on game state

    layers:
      - base: era theme (always playing)
      - overlay: civ motif (during encounters)
      - intensity: percussion/brass additions (war, danger)
      - ambient: terrain ambiance (always, low volume)

  transition_rules:
    era_change: "3-second crossfade between era themes"
    peace_to_war: "5-second crossfade with drum buildup"
    combat_start: "Quick 1-second stinger, then war theme"

  volume_mix:
    music: 0.7
    ambiance: 0.3
    sfx: 1.0
