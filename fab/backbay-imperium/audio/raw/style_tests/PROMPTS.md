| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Warmth** | Does it feel like afternoon sunlight, not fluorescent? |
| **Tempo** | Can you think strategically while listening? |
| **Fatigue** | Would this annoy after 30 minutes of gameplay? |
| **Authenticity** | Does it feel researched, not stereotypical? |
| **Production** | Clean recording quality, no artifacts? |

## Selecting Style Anchors

Pick 2-3 tracks that score 4+ on most criteria. These become your reference points.

Name your anchors:
- `ANCHOR_warm_contemplative.mp3` - The warmth reference
- `ANCHOR_brass_dignity.mp3` - The grandeur reference
- `ANCHOR_cultural_authentic.mp3` - The cultural instrument reference

Reference these when generating production tracks:
"Similar warmth and pacing to my warm_contemplative anchor"
